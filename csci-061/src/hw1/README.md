My solutions for the first homework assignment.
## Running the Code
This assumes that you have access to unix-like environment.
```bash
# To compile
c++ "./p1.cpp" -o p1
c++ "./p3.cpp" -o p3

# Then run with
./p1
./p3
```

If you have the just command installed you can use the shorthands.
```bash
# to compile
just build

# to test
just test
```
