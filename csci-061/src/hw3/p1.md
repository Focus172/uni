# B-TREES
Start with an empty B-tree of order 3 (a B-tree where each node can contain a
maximum of 2 keys and can have a maximum of 3 children).

- a) Insert the following letters in the given non-sorted sequence: F, D, B, A,
    C, E. Show the tree after each insertion.
- b) Following the sequence of insertions, delete the letters in the reverse
    order they were added (i.e., starting from E and ending with F). Display
    the tree after each deletion.
